# Data cleaning

The aim is to refine our dataset to ensure it is structured and ready for analysis.

The cleaned data should meet the following criteria and constraints:
- Only relevant columns should be retained.

# Discovery

- What did we learn?

We discovered that
1. United State is the highest order sales by country, followed by Ireland, with United Kingdom being the last top sales by country.
2. Don Flintiff, Nealson Cuttler, Terri Farra, Brenn Dundredge and Allis are the top customers by sales.
3. 2021 was the year with the highest sales with a sum of **$13,766**, 2020 sales was **$12,118**, 2019 sales was a total of **$12,187**, and lastly 2022 which was the lowest sales with a sum of **$7,063**.

 # Recommendations

- What do you recommend based on the insights gathered?

1. United State is the highest top sales by country, therefore i recommend we take more orders from United State compared to other countries. 
2. With regards to the top customers by sales, it may be worth considering collaborating or give out special offers, as the potential of return on investments is significantly high in the longrun.
3. Regarding the coffee types, the findings suggest that since Libirical and Arabica had the highest sales over the years, with Arabica reaching $841 in 2021 and Libirical achieving a total of about $844 in 2022, we recommend that the coffee shop produce more of these to maximize sales. Additionally, considering the fluctuation in sales from 2019 to 2022, we suggest analyzing the year with the highest sales and identifying the factors that contributed to that success to apply them in future years.


# Conclusion

Base on the findings and analysis of the coffee sale dashcoard, we can conclude that the project showcases the effectiveness of exploratory data analysis in providing useful insights in dataset that involved the customers, products and the orders.
